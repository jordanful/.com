I'm a founder, engineer, designer, product, software guy.

I'm currently building [Kaizen](https://kaizen.app), a product that helps teams build an open and honest culture through feedback. Previously, I led product at Rocketmiles, a B2C travel company acquired by Booking.com in 2015. I also spent time at Groupon, scaling and leading consumer design teams.

I like to learn and build and occasionally make modest angel investments.
